## Project Overview
This project is a Flutter application developed as part of an internship task. It demonstrates basic state management using `setState` and local persistent storage using `SharedPreferences`.

## Features

- Counter value saved and retrieved using SharedPreferences
- Simple to-do list application
- Add and display tasks using ListView
- Tasks stored locally using SharedPreferences

## Technologies Used
- Flutter
- Dart
- SharedPreferences

## How It Works
- The counter state is managed using setState.
- Counter value is stored locally and retrieved on app restart.
- To-do tasks are stored locally and displayed using a ListView.

## Notes
The application logic is complete and follows standard Flutter development practices. The project is ready to run on an Android device or emulator with proper configuration.
